# portfolio-rich
This is a portfolio for me to introduce my coding to the world.

### Thinkful
This is a required assignment from Thinkful. It was a very involved project because I'm not use to talking about myself or introducing myself.

### Project
The project is a simple html/css page with no javascript. When the course is over I plan to incorporate more so that it is more polished. Which as my skills grow in the class should not be a problem.
